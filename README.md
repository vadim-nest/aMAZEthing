OUR LINEUP: ISAAC PILTER: An oxford graduate, scoring both firsts in landing high academic marks AND BITCHES. He got bored one day and decided to step into codeworks inc and be better than every single instructor in there. He's cool, hes smart, but most importantly he's mathetically calculated to be the cutuest man alive. Charlotte agrees, I agree.

JOSEP VIEJO PUYOL: He's spanish, he's moody, and he isn't afraid to show it. Puyol may rock up to any venue in style with a georgous georgina by her side, but one thing he wont do, is rock up on time. If you ever had any trouble understanding a topic, don't worry, isaac is in the room as well! Puyol is way more handsome than his brother (he told me he wasnt happy that i wasnt complimenting him)!

VADIM: Allegdely a backstabber, but also stabs his husband's back every now and then. An inspiration to twink tops everywhere, Vadim not only grabbed himself a hubby, but a new passport within three months! Handsome, smart, and punny, Vadim SirGay is always a joy to be around!
